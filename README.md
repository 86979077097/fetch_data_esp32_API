# fetch_data_esp32_API
I developed an embedded application for the ESP32 that acts as a Bluetooth server, allowing a mobile client to connect and send commands via buttons in the form of JSON files. The ESP32 processes these commands to scan for WiFi networks, connect to a network, or fetch data from a REST API, and then sends the results back over Bluetooth.
